  This document describes how to use the «YtThumbs» application.
If you need to getting thumbnails of images from the YouTube service,
this can be done using this application. Links should be like this:
ytthumbs/LR_kZHEriCc/main.jpg, ytthumbs/LR_kZHEriCc/origin.jpg.
Thus, you can upload the original thumbnail or thumbnail with an icon.
To host the cache, you need to create a folder named «data» with
write permissions. Alexander Gladun © 2020 - 2023.
